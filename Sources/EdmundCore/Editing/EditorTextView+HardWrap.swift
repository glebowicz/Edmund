// Edit ▸ Hard Wrap Paragraphs — reflow paragraphs to 80 columns on demand.
//
// The automatic side of hard wrap lives at the document's edges (unwrap on
// open, re-wrap on save); this is the manual escape hatch for wrapping a file
// that didn't arrive wrapped, or re-flowing a paragraph mid-session.
//
// It rebuilds `rawSource` and goes through `recomposeReplacing` rather than
// `insertText`, because it rewrites a whole span at once — the same route
// Tab/Shift-Tab indentation takes, with the same caller obligations (undo
// snapshot, re-parse, viewport stabilization).
