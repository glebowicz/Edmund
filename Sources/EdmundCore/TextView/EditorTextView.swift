import AppKit

/// A single NSTextView with word-level inline preview.
///
/// ## Architecture
///
/// `rawSource` is the **sole source of truth** for document content.
/// The text storage always contains rawSource — no delimiter stripping.
/// All formatting is achieved through NSAttributedString attributes:
///   - Inline delimiters (`**`, `*`, `` ` ``, etc.) are hidden via near-zero
///     font size when the cursor is not inside the token.
///   - Block-level markers (`#`, `>`, `-`, etc.) are always visible and dimmed.
///   - Content gets rich text styling (bold, italic, colors, etc.).
///
/// **Edits** flow through NSTextView's normal path:
///   1. `shouldChangeText` records an undo snapshot (coalesced), returns `true`
///   2. NSTextView applies the edit to the text storage
///   3. `didChangeText` fires — we sync `rawSource` and re-style the block
///
/// **Cursor movement** is detected via `didChangeSelectionNotification`.
/// When the cursor moves to a different block, we restyle both blocks.
/// When it moves within a block, we update which token's delimiters
/// are visible (the "active token").
///
/// **Undo/Redo** uses custom stacks of `rawSource` snapshots, completely
/// bypassing NSTextView's built-in undo.
