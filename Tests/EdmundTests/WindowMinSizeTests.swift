/// The find bar must not decide how small the document window can get.
///
/// It is frame-managed (`autoresizingMask`), but its *contents* are laid out by
/// Auto Layout, so its required constraints reach the window as a
/// `contentMinSize`. A flexible-width autoresizing view only grows by the delta
/// from the width it was added at — so a bar parked at the default zero frame
/// only reaches the width its fields and buttons demand once the window is that
/// much wider than it opened. AppKit then took the minimum to be
/// `initial width + bar minimum` and inflated the opening frame to match, which
/// tied the window's initial size to its minimum and left `window.minSize`
/// doing nothing: an 800pt default opened at 1014pt and refused to shrink below
/// it, and dropping `minSize` to 320 changed neither number.
///
/// Only the live window server applies that minimum, so the window-level
/// symptom can't be asserted in-process (a headless `NSWindow` happily reports
/// a small `contentMinSize` and shrinks either way — both were tried, and both
/// passed against the bug). What is checkable here is the invariant the fix
/// rests on: the parked bar spans its container, so autoresizing keeps it
/// there instead of chasing the width the window opened at. Measured against
/// the running app: 800pt default → opens 800, shrinks to the 320 `minSize`.
