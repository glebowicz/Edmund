# Edmund — architecture & agent onboarding

Native macOS Markdown editor with live preview (AppKit + TextKit 2, SPM,
macOS 14+). Read this before any non-trivial change. **Keep it updated** —
when you learn something non-obvious or change an invariant, edit this file
in the same PR.

This is the agent-oriented canonical summary — dense, terse. Humans wanting
the narrative write-up start at
[`docs/architecture/README.md`](architecture/README.md); the same-PR update
rule applies to both.

---

## 1. Build / run / test

```bash
swift build                 # debug build of both targets
swift test                  # full suite (≈1200 tests, ~10s)
swift test --filter Callout # one suite
./scripts/build-app.sh      # builds build/Edmund.app (release + bundles + icon + codesign)
```

Run the app for visual checks (gotchas in §8):
```bash
pkill -x edmd; build/Edmund.app/Contents/MacOS/edmd /path/to/file.md &
```

Two SPM targets (`Package.swift`):
- **`EdmundCore`** — library: all editor logic, parsing, rendering,
  `EditorTextView`. Has the tests. **Most work happens here.**
- **`edmd`** — executable: `NSDocument` app shell, Settings (SwiftUI), menus,
  window setup.

Dependencies: `swift-markdown` (CommonMark/GFM), `SwiftMath` (LaTeX),
`Sparkle` (auto-update).

---

## 2. The two non-negotiable invariants

Break either and the whole editor misbehaves in subtle ways.

1. **Text storage always equals `rawSource`.** Rendering is *attribute-only*
   — never insert/delete display characters. Delimiters (`**`, `` ` ``,
   `[!note]`, …) are *hidden* (near-zero font + clear color), never stripped.
   Consequences: no `NSTextAttachment` (TextKit 2 only honors them on U+FFFC,
   which `rawSource` never contains — images/icons are drawn as overlays
   instead, §5); display offset == raw offset (identity mapping).

2. **TextKit 2 only.** Never touch `NSTextView.layoutManager`, never store
   `NSTextBlock`/`NSTextTable` attributes — either silently reverts the view
   to TextKit 1 for good. A DEBUG tripwire asserts if TK1 engages. Layout is
   viewport-based (only on-screen content laid out) — that's what makes big
   documents fast.

---

## 3. Rendering pipeline (the core loop)

```
rawSource ─BlockParser─▶ [Block] ─SyntaxHighlighter─▶ spans ─styleBlock─▶ attributes in storage
```

- **`BlockParser`** (`Parsing/`) splits `rawSource` into `Block`s (paragraph,
  heading — ATX or setext, list run, quote/callout run, code fence, indented
  code run, table…). `Block.kind` is a `BlockKind` enum (e.g.
  `.quoteRun(isCallout:)`). Indented code is the parser's only
  backward-looking rule (a run starts only after a blank line), so
  `consumeBlock` carries `prevLine` and the incremental parse won't resync
  onto an indented-code-ish line. Lists are one block per line, except a list
  item whose content opens an unclosed `$$` merges its `$$…$$` display-math run
  (forward, like the fence rules) so the span can form across lines.
- **`SyntaxHighlighter`** + `+Walker`/`+WalkerInline`/`+CustomParsers`
  produce styling spans. Custom parsers handle the non-CommonMark syntax:
  callouts, `==highlight==`, wikilinks, `%%` and `<!-- -->` comments,
  footnotes, math, backslash escapes, inline HTML tags incl. `<img>`, GFM
  autolinks.
- **`styleBlock(_:cursorPosition:)`** (`Rendering/EditorTextView+Rendering.swift`)
  renders ONE block. Each feature has a `Rendering/` extension: Callout,
  Code, Image, List, ListMarker, Math, Table, WikiLinks.
- **Recompose** (`TextView/EditorTextView+Composition.swift`) drives styling:
  - `recompose(cursorInRaw:)` — full: replace storage with rawSource, restyle
    all blocks (load, undo, indent).
  - `recomposeDirty(_:cursorInRaw:)` — restyle a set of block indices in
    place (the workhorse; attribute-only).
  - `recomposeIncremental(...)` — restyle just the block(s) the cursor moved
    between (most cursor moves).
  - **Active block**: the block under the caret renders its *raw* markdown
    (delimiters visible/editable); all others render styled.
- **Lazy styling** (`TextView/EditorTextView+LazyStyling.swift`): a large
  dirty set styles only the viewport synchronously; the rest is finished by
  the **idle drain** (time-budgeted main-thread slices) and **scroll
  promotion** (style blocks as they enter the viewport). Keeps large docs
  responsive.

---

## 4. Edit flow & undo

- Edits go through NSTextView's normal path: `shouldChangeText` records a
  coalesced undo snapshot → NSTextView mutates storage → `didChangeText`
  syncs `rawSource` and restyles the edited block(s) (`+EditFlow`,
  `+Composition`).
- **Incremental parsing**: edits capture a pending edit on
  `EditorTextStorage`; reparse a window, not the whole doc.
- **Undo/redo** is custom: stacks of `rawSource` snapshots (`+Undo.swift`),
  bypassing NSTextView's undo. Restore *diffs* the snapshot against current
  text (`textDiff`, single contiguous span) and applies it via the
  range-bounded `recomposeReplacing` — never a full `recompose`, which would
  reset every fragment to a TK2 height estimate and make the follow-up
  scroll land wrong. The changed text is selected (caret at the deletion
  point for pure deletions) and drives the viewport: hold if any of it is
  on-screen, else center it. The snapshot's stored caret is only a fallback
  for a no-op diff.
- **Cursor tracking** (`+SelectionTracking`): moving between blocks restyles
  both; moving within a block updates which token's delimiters are revealed.

---

## 5. TextKit 2 specifics (how visuals are drawn)

- **`DecoratedTextLayoutFragment`** (custom `NSTextLayoutFragment`,
  `+TextKit2.swift`) draws two custom attributes behind/over the text:
  - **`.blockDecoration`** (paragraph-level): callout boxes, quote bars,
    table borders, thematic-break rules, code-block backgrounds. Fragments
    tile vertically, so a multi-line run renders as one continuous box/bar.
    A box's `bottomPad` grows the *last* fragment's frame (TK2 omits
    trailing paragraph spacing from the fragment; draw-time-only padding
    would be dead space).
  - **`.fragmentOverlay`** (character-level): an image *or stroked vector
    path* drawn at a character's laid-out position — rendered math, list
    bullets/checkboxes, callout header icon+name image, custom-title callout
    icon (path). The anchor glyph is hidden and `.kern` reserves the
    drawing's advance width (same trick as the table renderer).
- **Hiding** text = `hiddenFont` (≈0.01pt) + clear `foregroundColor` — how
  delimiters and in-source markers vanish without changing the string.
- **Dark-mode chrome palette** (`+ListRendering.swift`): the system semantic
  colors are too faint on the `#292929` background, so dark mode substitutes
  fixed sRGB grays and Read mode's CSS vars carry the same values, so the two
  views match pixel-for-pixel. `syntaxDimColor` (the whole dim tier —
  delimiters, `%%comments%%`, `^blockrefs`, list markers, quote bars) →
  `darkChromeGray` #696969 = `--marker`; table borders → `darkRuleGray`
  #555555 = `--table-border`; the `---` rule → `darkHRuleGray` #4a4a4a =
  `--hr`; body text → #e6e6e6 = `--fg`; code backgrounds #333333 = `--code-bg`
  with inline code a step above at #3c3c3c = `--inline-code-bg`. Light mode
  keeps the semantic colors. Build these with `srgbRed:`, **not**
  `NSColor(hex:)` or `calibratedWhite:` — the calibrated space renders visibly
  lighter than the hex it was given (same trap as `editorBackgroundColor`).
- **Hairlines are filled, not stroked.** A 1pt stroke straddles a pixel
  boundary and covers *two* device rows on Retina, so stroked table verticals
  read twice as heavy as the row rules beside them. Table column borders fill
  exactly one device pixel and the `---` rule fills three. The backing scale
  comes from `context.convertToDeviceSpace(CGSize(width: 1, height: 1))` —
  `context.ctm.a` reports 1 even at 2x.
- **Image overlays only work on single-line fragments.** An *image* on a
  *multi-line* (wrapping) fragment re-triggers a layout pass that wedges it
  to one line; a *shape* does not. So the wrapping callout custom title's
  icon is a stroked `CGPath` (`SVGPath` parses the vendored Lucide
  geometry), never an image — see
  `docs/investigations/archives/callout-title-wrap-investigation.md`.
- **Repeated immutable overlays are process-cached.** List markers, callout
  headers/icons, and identical math overlays must reuse the same
  `FragmentOverlay` value across editor instances. Creating one per block
  grows Foundation's process-wide weak attribute-dictionary intern table and
  makes later lazy-styling slices progressively slower. Cache keys include
  every visual/metric input, and the `NSCache`-backed marker caches are bounded.
- **Custom attributed-string values need discriminating hashes.** Value
  equality paired with constant-by-kind/count hashes turns Foundation's global
  attribute-dictionary interner into a collision chain and makes styling
  superlinear. Hash every field used by equality whenever the value permits it.

## 6. Feature map (where to look)

| Area | Files |
| --- | --- |
| Editor core / state | `TextView/EditorTextView.swift` (+ many extensions) |
| Parsing | `Parsing/BlockParser.swift`, `SyntaxHighlighter*.swift`, `CodeHighlighter.swift`, `CodeSyntaxPalette.swift` (shared Tomorrow/One-Dark hex table — read by both the editor's `NSColor` palette and the HTML CSS generator) |
| Code-fence highlighting | A pluggable seam, not a hardcoded scanner. `CodeHighlighter` is the facade: it resolves the effective language, then hands `(code, language)` to the active `CodeSyntaxBackend`. `BuiltinSyntaxBackend` is the default — one single-pass O(n) char scanner driven by a declarative `LanguageDefinition` (keywords, comment/string delimiters) rather than per-language code. `SyntaxDefinitionStore` loads those definitions from two places: the bundled JSON in `EdmundCore/Resources/Syntaxes/` and the user's Application Support dir, so **users can add a language without a rebuild**. Settings ▸ Syntax picks the fallback language (`settings.syntax.defaultCodeSyntax`). |
| Block model | `Model/Block.swift`, `Callout.swift`, `EditorTheme.swift`, `ListIndentState.swift`, `LinkDefinitionState.swift` (incremental index of `[label]: dest` reference-link definitions, which resolve across blocks — so a definition edit dirties the blocks that cite it), `LineEnding.swift` (buffer is always LF internally so `BlockParser`'s `\n` split stays clean; the file's original CRLF/CR style is remembered and written back on save), `StatusBarPrefs.swift`, `SVGPath.swift` (minimal SVG→`CGPath` for the vendored Lucide geometry — §5's wrapping-callout icon) |
| Text storage | `TextView/EditorTextStorage.swift` — `NSTextStorage` subclass whose `fixAttributes` does **font substitution only**. The editor manages every attribute on every character (incl. custom keys like `.blockDecoration`/`.fragmentOverlay`), so AppKit's usual attribute fixing would fight it. Substitution is **cascade-aware**: when `EditorTheme.fontCascade` assigns a font to a script (`Model/FontCascade.swift` — `FontCascadeScript` classifier + `FontCascadeResolver` cache), graphemes of that script get the user's font (at the run's size × the script's `fontCascadeSizeRatios` entry) *before* coverage is even checked, and the generic CoreText fallback pass skips those sequences (applied later in the same fix list, it would silently overwrite the cascade). The UTF-16 pre-scan bound is U+00A9, not U+0300: ©/® are `isEmoji` and lead the emoji CSS range, so a higher bound would let a "© 2026" line keep the body font in Edit while Read paints the emoji face. Empty cascade ⇒ byte-identical pre-cascade behavior. Also carries the `pendingEdit` that drives incremental reparse (§4) and the bypassed-edit heal (§8). |
| Markdown feature toggles | `Model/MarkdownFeatures.swift` — one `OptionSet` (`.all` default) gating each extension (highlight, `%%`comment, callout, wikilink, footnote, math, image dimensions `\|WxH`, `![[embed]]`, collapsible callouts `[!x]-/+`, plus Phase-2 front-matter/tag/blockRef/multi-block-comment). Threaded into `SyntaxHighlighter.parse(features:)` (gates each custom-parser pass; callout gated at render via `calloutInfo`), `EditorTextView.markdownFeatures` (didSet recompose), and `ReadRenderOptions.features` (→ `HTMLRenderer`). Assembled from per-feature UserDefaults toggles by `AppSettings.markdownFeatures`; Settings ▸ Syntax pane. A cleared flag renders the syntax as plain text in **both** back-ends. |
| Rendering | `Rendering/EditorTextView+*Rendering.swift` (Callout, Code, Image, List, Math, Table, WikiLinks) |
| Invisible characters | `TextView/EditorTextView+Invisibles.swift` — faint marks (· → ¬ ␣ ▯) overdrawn on laid-out whitespace, riding `DecoratedTextLayoutFragment.draw`. Pure display overlay: no characters inserted, TextKit 2 only. `EditorTextView.invisibles` ← `AppSettings.invisiblesConfig`; Settings ▸ Edit. Mechanism: [`architecture/editor-affordances.md`](architecture/editor-affordances.md). |
| List indent guides | Faint vertical hairlines on list items: one per *ancestor* level spanning the item, plus the item's own column beside its wrapped continuation lines. Offsets from `listGuideOffsets(depth:slotWidth:)` (`Rendering/EditorTextView+ListRendering.swift`), written to `.listGuides` **whether or not the setting is on** — the fragment gates the drawing, so toggling is a re-vend, never a restyle. `EditorTextView.showListIndentGuides`; Settings ▸ Edit. Geometry traps (container-relative offsets, `lineFragmentPadding`): [`architecture/editor-affordances.md`](architecture/editor-affordances.md). |
| Line numbers | `TextView/EditorTextView+LineNumbers.swift` — source line numbers (Settings ▸ Edit ▸ Lines, off by default), `EditorTextView.showLineNumbers`. **Two placements over one walk**, and the placement is **not** a setting: it follows whether the margin can hold them (beside the content by default, a `LineNumberRulerView` at the window edge otherwise). Also home to `line(forOffset:)`/`offset(forLine:)`, binary-searching the cached `lineStarts`. Editor-only; never printed. Placement rules, the macOS 14 SIGSEGV, draw rules and the tabular-figure face: [`architecture/editor-affordances.md`](architecture/editor-affordances.md). |
| Focus mode | `TextView/EditorTextView+FocusMode.swift` — dims all but the lines the selection touches (Settings ▸ Edit ▸ Editor, Edit ▸ Focus Mode; off by default), `EditorTextView.focusMode`. **One transparency layer around `DecoratedTextLayoutFragment.draw`**, so text and its decorations fade as one composite; it cannot be a scrim (NSTextView composites fragments *after* `draw(_:)` returns). Editor-only. Why, and the measurements: [`architecture/editor-affordances.md`](architecture/editor-affordances.md). |
| Read mode / Export | `Export/` — `HTMLRenderer` (MarkupVisitor → HTML; callout/checkbox icons are inline Lucide SVGs from `LucideIcons`), `HTMLTheme` (EditorTheme → CSS; the font cascade becomes one `@font-face { src: local("Family"); unicode-range: … }` block per configured script — plus `size-adjust` when the script has a size ratio — with the cascade families leading `--body-font`), `DocumentHTML` (assembly + asset inlining: math + local images → data URIs), `ReadModeWebView`, `MarkdownPrinter` (PDF/Print). `Document.refreshReadView()` keeps an open Read view in sync with edits and theme changes. |
| Icons | `Model/LucideIcons.swift` — vendored [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) SVGs (ISC, `LICENSES/lucide.txt`). Callout headers use them in **both** modes: Read inlines the SVG (CSS-tinted via `currentColor`); Edit rasterizes to a tinted `NSImage` overlay. SF Symbols can't ship in exported PDFs (license); app-chrome SF Symbols are fine (in-app UI). Edit-mode task checkboxes still use SF Symbols (on-screen only); Read-mode checkboxes are a composed Lucide SVG. |
| Edit behaviors | `Editing/EditorTextView+{List,Blockquote}Continuation.swift`, `+Indentation.swift`, `+AutoPairs.swift`, `+ListRenumbering.swift` |
| Hard wrap | `Editing/HardWrap.swift` (pure `wrap`/`unwrap`) + `Editing/EditorTextView+HardWrap.swift` (Edit ▸ Hard Wrap Paragraphs). Settings ▸ Edit ▸ Document, off by default; read at **load/save time in `Document`**, not pushed onto the editor. Treated as a property of the *file*: opening a wrapped file joins its paragraphs, save re-wraps, and **only files that arrived wrapped are wrapped** (`wasHardWrapped`). The column is **derived from the file's own existing breaks**, not guessed. Requires strict line breaks. Full rules, GFM constraints and perf numbers: [`architecture/hard-wrap.md`](architecture/hard-wrap.md). |
| Formatting commands | `Editing/EditorTextView+Formatting{Core,Commands}.swift` (Format-menu actions); menu built from `edmd/App/FormatMenu.swift` |
| Lazy/compose/undo/scroll | `TextView/EditorTextView+{Composition,LazyStyling,Undo,TypewriterScroll,SelectionTracking,ContentWidth,EditFlow}.swift` |
| App shell | `edmd/App/{main,Document,DocumentController}.swift`; menu bar in `main.swift` `setupMenuBar()` + `FormatMenu.swift`; Sparkle `SPUStandardUpdaterController` in `AppDelegate` |
| macOS integrations | Services menu (`edmd/App/ServicesProvider.swift` + `NSServices` in `Info.plist`), App Intents (`edmd/App/Intents.swift`), Quick Look preview (`EdmundQuickLook` target, hosts `ReadModeWebView`), AppleScript code-fence syntax (`EdmundCore/Resources/Syntaxes/applescript.json`). **Two shipped-but-not-live-verifiable limitations** (App Intents metadata needs an Xcode-project build; the Quick Look appex won't launch under ad-hoc signing): [`architecture/macos-integrations.md`](architecture/macos-integrations.md). |
| Settings (SwiftUI) | `edmd/Settings/*` (AppSettings = UserDefaults keys; FontSettings; Appearance/General/Advanced views) |
| Key bindings | `edmd/Settings/KeyBindingStore.swift` + `KeyBindingsSettingsView.swift`. Every rebindable command is a `MenuCommand` (`App/FormatMenu.swift`) with a stable `id`, a `group` (the menu it lives under) and a default `Shortcut`; `makeItem()` resolves the user's override from `KeyBindingStore` and registers the built `NSMenuItem` in `KeyBindingCatalog`, so the pane retunes shortcuts live without rebuilding the menu bar. Overrides live in one UserDefaults dict (`settings.keyBindings`, `id → "shift+cmd+e"`); an empty string means "user removed this shortcut", a missing key means "use the default". **Moving a command between menus means renaming its id, and a rename must come with a migration** — an override is filed under the id, so renaming it alone strands the user's shortcut under a key nothing reads. That doesn't fall back to the default, it silently stops firing. `KeyBindingStore.migrateRenamedIDs` (called first thing in `setupMenuBar()`) re-files them, leaving alone any binding already set under the new id; add a pair to its `renamedIDs` table whenever you move one. Conflicts are checked against the **live `NSApp.mainMenu`**, not the catalog, so system items (⌘S, ⌘C) count too; a chord without ⌘ or ⌃ is refused outright (it would fire while typing). Only Edmund's own commands are listed — the OS-standard items stay fixed. File ▸ Close (`main.swift`) makes AppKit inject an ⌥⌘W *Close All* alternate, so that one `addItem` call reserves both chords in this scan. |
| Crash-log uploading | `EdmundCore/Diagnostics/CrashReporter.swift` (§7) |
| Auto-update | Sparkle 2.x. `Info.plist`: `SUFeedURL` (raw GitHub URL to `appcast.xml`), `SUPublicEDKey`. `scripts/release.sh`: build → DMG (sindresorhus `create-dmg`, **npm** — not the homebrew tool) → EdDSA sign → update appcast → `gh release create`. The DMG is the Sparkle enclosure. CI: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (tag-triggered). Full pipeline + signing + `RELEASE_TOKEN`: §13. |
| Find & Replace | `EdmundCore/Find/FindEngine.swift` (pure search), `TextView/EditorTextView+Find.swift` (match state, highlight drawing, pop animation, `EditorFindHandling`), `edmd/Views/FindBarView.swift` (the bar), `edmd/App/FindController.swift` (mediator); Edit ▸ Find menu in `main.swift` |
| Format bar | `edmd/Views/FormatBarView.swift` (layout + state refresh) and `FormatBarControls.swift` (the controls), on `ChromeBarView.swift` (titlebar-material + hairline base shared with the find bar), `edmd/App/FormatMenu.swift` (the two pulldowns are the same `headingMenu()`/`calloutMenu()` factories as the Format menu — one menu definition, three homes), `Document.formatBar` (owned by the document; **off by default**, toggled by View ▸ Show/Hide Format Bar, `settings.edit.showFormatBar`, force-hidden in Reading mode). Stacks **above** the find bar, both through `layoutTopBars()` (§6 top-bar insets). Bar is horizontally centred by design (a narrow window clips the same reachable band on both sides — on 26+ that means the outermost capsules leave the window entirely at widths near the 320pt minimum). On 26+ each of its five control groups rides in its own `NSGlassEffectView` capsule (§ Liquid Glass chrome) and the intra-group hairlines are dropped |
| Format-bar on-state | `EdmundCore/Editing/EditorTextView+FormattingState.swift` — the read-only counterpart to the toggles: `activeFormattingActions()`, `activeHeadingLevel()`, `activeCalloutType()`, refreshed from `editorDidChange` / `editorSelectionDidChange`. It scans **source delimiters, not rendered attributes**, because the attributes are lossy for this: a heading is also bold, and `==mark==` and a code span are both a background fill. Star *run length* is what separates `*x*` / `**x**` / `***x***`. A callout deliberately does not also light Block Quote (it is one underneath, but the callout pulldown gives the more specific answer). Hover/on chips live on `BarControlChip`; a chip is a fixed-height box centred on the bar's `interior`, **not** on the control's own bounds — sizing it per control made every symbol a different chip height. |
| Standard text menus | `edmd/App/main.swift` — Edit ▸ Spelling and Grammar, Transformations, Speech; stock `NSTextView` actions routed to the first responder. **Substitutions is deliberately excluded** (§8) |
| Status bar | `edmd/Views/StatusBarView.swift` |
| Build/packaging | `scripts/build-app.sh` (release build + Sparkle.framework embedding + signing), `Package.swift`, `Info.plist`, `Resources/` |

Notable subsystems:

- **A draw-only setting needs more than `invalidateLayout` to appear.** The
  layout manager hands back its *cached* fragments, so a paragraph vended as a
  plain `NSTextLayoutFragment` stays plain and the new overdraw never shows
  (measured: a live toggle drew nothing until the next edit). `refreshOverdraw()`
  also pokes the storage with an attributes-only `edited(.editedAttributes, …)`
  — no text change, no restyle, no undo entry — to force a re-vend. Invisibles,
  list indent guides and focus mode all depend on it; the affordances that use
  it are in
  [`architecture/editor-affordances.md`](architecture/editor-affordances.md).

- **Typewriter scroll**: keeps caret vertically centered. Must lay out the
  viewport↔caret span before measuring (else stale TK2 estimates);
  re-centers only on *typing* — a mouse-down sets
  `suppressTypewriterCentering` so click-placing the caret doesn't yank the
  viewport. Centering scrolls, so the mode also needs somewhere to scroll
  *to*: `updateScrollOverscroll` reserves half a clip height of blank space
  above the first line while it is on. Without that slack the first screenful,
  the last screenful and any document shorter than the window can never reach
  center, which is what made the feature read as "doesn't center at all".
- **Overscroll past the ends** (`updateScrollOverscroll`): half a clip height
  below the last line in both modes (so the line being written is never pinned
  to the window's bottom edge, and typewriter scroll can center the last
  line), plus the typewriter-only room above. The space is bought **inside the
  document view** — `textContainerInset.height` grows the frame by twice its
  height and the overridden `textContainerOrigin` decides how that splits
  between the ends (`overscrollTopPad` / `overscrollBottomPad`), followed by an
  explicit `sizeToFit()`, since the frame doesn't track the inset otherwise.
  Not `NSScrollView.contentInsets`: AppKit restricts hit-testing to the scroll
  view's frame *minus* its insets, so half a viewport at each end left a
  zero-height live area and no click anywhere in the window moved the caret
  (§8). `setFrameSize` also floors the view at the clip height, so a document
  shorter than the window still covers it — the area below a short text view
  belongs to the clip view, which swallows clicks. The scroll code still asks
  the clip view for its limits (`clampedScrollY` wraps `constrainBoundsRect`)
  rather than hand-rolling a clamp; `preservingViewportAnchor` is the
  exception and floors at 0 only, since it runs mid-re-tile when the clip
  view's idea of the document height is stale (clamping there yanked the
  viewport ~770pt).
- **Top chrome bars are the one thing that *does* use `contentInsets`**
  (`applyTopBarInset`, `+ContentWidth.swift`). The find and format bars stack
  under the toolbar and hand their combined height to `editor.additionalTopInset`
  via `Document.layoutTopBars()` — the sole writer, so a resize recomputing the
  overscroll can't drop a bar's share. `layoutTopBars()` also carries each bar's
  visibility onto its host view, not just the bar: on 26+ that used to be an
  `NSGlassEffectView` wrapper, and hiding only the bar inside it left the
  wrapper frosting an empty band across the middle of the document.
  - Pre-26, the band a top bar costs is the band it covers, so the live area
    only loses what the reader could not click anyway. **On 26+ that is no
    longer true**: the bars are floating glass capsules with the document
    visible between them (§ Liquid Glass chrome), so `ChromeBarView.hitTest`
    returns nil outside the capsules and the gaps stay clickable text. Without
    that override the reserved band is an invisible dead strip.
  - The inset does **not** shrink the clip view. The clip still spans the whole
    scroll view and the document scrolls *under* the bar; what moves is the
    scroll range's top end, from 0 to `-inset`. So the bars add no document
    height — no overscroll, unlike the ends above.
  - Every conversion between clip coordinates and "the top of what the reader
    can see" must therefore add `viewportTopInset`, and use
    `visibleContentHeight` (clip height *minus* the bars) where it used to use
    the clip height. Typewriter centering, `scrollCharacterToTop` and
    `topmostVisibleCharacterOffset` all do.
  - **Sample the scroll origin *before* assigning the inset.** Shrinking it
    re-clamps the clip view immediately, so an origin read afterwards has
    already absorbed part of the delta — subtracting it again scrolled the
    document *down* by a bar's height when a bar closed. Covered by
    `TopBarInsetTests`.
  - Set `automaticallyAdjustsContentInsets = false` first, or AppKit recomputes
    the insets from the titlebar and stamps on the bars' value.
- **Content width** (`+ContentWidth.swift`): an **absolute physical**
  max-column width — set in cm/in in Settings, stored as cm, converted to
  points via the display's real PPI (`NSScreen.physicalPPI`, from
  `CGDisplayScreenSize`). Applied as a symmetric `textContainerInset.width`
  cap: wider windows center the column, narrower ones fill. Recomputed on
  resize and on moving to a differently-scaled display
  (`NSWindow.didChangeScreenNotification`).
- **Format menu & shortcuts**: pure AppKit (no SwiftUI scene, so SwiftUI
  `Commands` isn't an option). `FormatMenu.swift` is a declarative command
  table (`MenuCommand` + `Shortcut`, each with a stable `id` so a later pass
  can read per-command shortcut overrides from UserDefaults). Items use a
  nil target and route through the responder chain to the focused
  `EditorTextView`'s `@objc format…` actions — same wiring as undo/redo.
  Actions funnel through two primitives in `+FormattingCore.swift`:
  `applyFormattingEdit` (single contiguous edit, modeled on the Tab-indent
  path) and `applyWholeDocumentEdit` (non-contiguous, e.g. footnotes).
- **View modes**: ⌘E (View menu + toolbar button) *toggles* editing ↔ Read
  via `Document.toggleViewMode`. **Source is not a third toggle stop** —
  it's a persisted preference (`AppSettings.sourceMode`, a "Source Mode"
  checkbox in the View menu and the toolbar button's right-click menu):
  when on, the editing half of the toggle is Source instead of Edit, and a
  freshly opened document honors it. The toolbar button left-clicks to
  toggle, right-clicks for the full mode menu (§8: why that right-click is
  intercepted in `DocumentWindow.sendEvent`). Toolbar has
  `allowsUserCustomization = true` (an AppKit `NSToolbar` feature).
- **Read mode is a separate WKWebView**, not an editor styling mode.
  `.reading` swaps the editor's scroll view for a `ReadModeWebView`
  rendering themed HTML (`Export/`); Edit and Source stay on the
  `EditorTextView`. One parser, two back-ends (`SpanCollector` → editor
  attributes, `HTMLRenderer` → HTML), same `EditorTheme` via `HTMLTheme` —
  the two can't drift. Sandboxed: JS disabled, `script-src 'none'` CSP,
  `baseURL: nil`, every asset inlined as data URIs; remote images off by
  default (`ReadRenderOptions.allowRemoteImages`); external
  `http`/`https`/`mailto` links open in the browser, `file:`/unknown
  schemes cancelled; wikilinks/relative links use private
  `x-edmund-wiki:`/`x-edmund-link:` schemes the nav coordinator intercepts.
  **Inspect Reader (⌥⌘I)** is a semi-toggle on `Document`, not on the web
  view, so it works from Edit too: it switches to Read and opens WebKit's
  private `_inspector`, and closes it when already up; entering Edit always
  hides it. The read view's context menu carries the same item as "Inspect
  Element", with WebKit's own duplicate removed.
  **Export as PDF… / Print… (⌘P)** run the same HTML through
  `WKWebView.printOperation` (`MarkdownPrinter`; vector text, math is
  high-DPI PNG). Full spec: `docs/architecture/reader-and-export.md`.
- **Find & Replace** (in-document, ⌘F / ⌥⌘F / ⌘G / ⇧⌘G): **not**
  `NSTextFinder` — it renders the system bar rather than the Notes look, and
  its highlighting drives `NSLayoutManager`, which the TextKit 2 tripwire
  (§2) forbids. Instead: `FindEngine` is a pure `NSString.range(of:)` scan
  (case-sensitive / whole-word options, no regex) over `rawSource`; because
  of the identity invariant, search index == raw index == display index, so
  there is **no offset mapping**. Highlighting is **draw-only** — a
  `drawBackground(in:)` override fills rects from
  `enumerateTextSegments(in:type:.highlight)`, offset by
  `textContainerOrigin` — so it never writes attributes into storage and
  can't perturb recompose. Navigation never moves the caret (that would
  trigger the active-block-renders-raw recompose); it scrolls via
  `revealFindMatch`, which leaves an already-visible match alone and
  otherwise puts the hit's line at the top. Every match gets a grey resting
  background; the one just navigated to also gets a Preview-style "pop" — a
  drop-shadowed rounded yellow box that springs in from a larger scale with
  an `easeOutBack` overshoot, holds, then fades, driven by a `CADisplayLink`
  (constants at the top of `+Find.swift`). Replace / Replace All are the
  only paths that touch text and go through the sanctioned edit cycle (§4),
  Replace All rebuilding the source back-to-front so it lands as one undo
  step. EdmundCore stays unaware of the controller via the
  `EditorFindHandling` protocol — the same decoupling as
  `contextFontMenuProvider`. The bar itself is an `NSGridView` (2×2) so the
  two fields share a left edge and the `‹ ›` / `Replace|All` clusters share
  theirs; find-only is one row and toggling Replace reveals the second and
  moves **Done** down onto it, with a hairline along the bar's bottom edge
  (whichever row is last) matching the toolbar separator.
  **Keyboard model.** ⌘F and ⌥⌘F each *toggle their own* bar — the shortcut
  for the bar already showing closes it, the other switches to it, so ⌘F from
  the replace bar drops the replace row rather than closing outright:

  | from | ⌘F | ⌥⌘F |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | closed | find | replace |
  | find | closed | replace |
  | replace | find | closed |

  Return / ⇧Return in the search field step to the next / previous match, as
  do ⌘G / ⇧⌘G. Tab walks the bar in visual order and wraps — including
  *inside* the segmented controls, so `‹`, `›`, `Replace` and `All` are each
  individually reachable — and ⇧Tab walks it in reverse. Both behaviours
  needed AppKit worked around; see §8.
- **Mode-switch viewport sync** (Edit ↔ Read, line-accurate both ways):
  read HTML blocks carry `id="edmund-l<startLine>"` anchors; scroll maps as
  (anchor line, fraction-into-block) via API-injected `evaluateJavaScript`
  (a trusted channel — content-JS-off and the CSP don't gate it); both
  directions share the same `lineCount` denominator so an untouched round
  trip is a fixed point; both swaps are deferred so no intermediate frame
  shows. Full spec: `docs/architecture/reader-and-export.md`. Two hard-won
  gotchas (§8): capture the anchor *before* the `viewMode` setter runs;
  far scrolls must style-then-lay-out everything above the target before
  measuring.

## 7. Settings & persistence

- `AppSettings` (`edmd/Settings`) = UserDefaults keys + typed accessors.
  SwiftUI panes use `@AppStorage`. Live changes broadcast to every open
  `Document.editor` (the font/line-height/content-width `applyTo…` helpers).
- **Seven panes**, built by `SettingsWindowController.addPane`: General,
  Appearance, Edit, Syntax, Key Bindings, Extensions, Advanced. Keys are
  namespaced to match (`settings.<pane>.<name>`), so the key tells you which
  pane owns it. There is no "Markdown" pane — the Markdown feature toggles
  (§6) live under `settings.syntax.*`. The per-script font cascade is NOT a
  pane: it is a collapsed "Fonts by script" section at the foot of Appearance
  (`EditorFontCascade` = `[script: family]` dict, `EditorFontCascadeSizeRatios`
  = `[script: ratio]` — ratios of the body size, so zoom and body-size changes
  scale the cascade for free; unset scripts keep the system fallback). The
  section's rows live in the pane's own Grid with fixed-width labels: a
  section hosted in a `gridCellColumns(2)` cell feeds its width back into the
  columns it spans and slides every row sideways as it opens. Fixed-width
  labels alone don't finish the job — the Grid hands leftover width to
  whichever column can grow, so EVERY column-2 cell in the pane is
  `maxWidth: .infinity`; otherwise the collapsed pane's slack lands in the
  label column and expanding the section still shifts every column-2
  control sideways.
- This section owns the *mechanism* and the settings with non-obvious
  behavior, not the full key list — that inventory drifts fastest and lives in
  `.claude/skills/edmund-config-and-flags/`. Grep
  `Sources/edmd/Settings/AppSettings.swift` for the current truth.
- Theme/appearance/fonts flow into `EditorTheme` → the editor's derived
  `bodyFont`, colors, paragraph styles.
- **Max content width** persists as **centimetres** (`maxContentWidthCm`);
  cm/in is a display unit (`contentWidthUnit`), the column is always
  physical (§6). Default is locale-aware — 5 in (US) / 12 cm (elsewhere) —
  and is the slider's magnetic snap point; slider range: 3 in floor → the
  screen's physical width (`NSScreen.physicalWidthCm`).
- **Window size** persists as the last window's full **frame** size
  (`settings.window.lastWidth`/`lastHeight`) — §8 on why frame, not content
  size.
- **"Reopen windows from last session" (`reopenWindows`) has to be enforced in
  two places**, because AppKit brings work back by two independent routes:
  1. *Window restoration.* Document windows are `isRestorable = true` for the
     whole session so a crash can hand back unsaved work;
     `AppDelegate.applicationShouldTerminate` clears the flag on a **clean**
     quit when the preference is off, so nothing is archived. A blank untitled
     document is the exception: it holds nothing a crash could hand back, so
     `Document` leaves its window unarchived and gives it the flag on the first
     edit (`updateChangeCount`) instead. An *unclean* exit never runs
     `applicationShouldTerminate`, and what AppKit restores from that archive
     arrives through `NSDocumentController`'s own restoration path
     (`_restorePersistentDocumentWithState:` → `_openUntitledDocumentOfType:`),
     which neither route-2's `reopenDocument` nor
     `applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile` sees — so a blank window that *is*
     archived cannot be stopped downstream.
  2. *Drafts.* With autosave-in-place on (`Document.autosavesInPlace` =
     `autoSaveWithVersions`, default on), every unsaved **untitled** document is
     kept by AppKit as a draft in `~/Library/Autosave Information/Unsaved edmd
     Document N.md` (`edmd` = the executable name) and reopened at the next
     launch through
     `NSDocumentController.reopenDocument(for:withContentsOf:display:)`. That
     route ignores `isRestorable` entirely, so route 1 never reached it: stale
     drafts came back at *every* launch and stacked up as "Untitled",
     "Untitled 2", … on top of the blank launch document.
     `DocumentController.reopenDocument` overrides it and skips drafts
     (`urlOrNil == nil`) when the preference is off. It only skips the reopen —
     the draft files are never deleted. Once skipped, AppKit drops the draft
     from its restore record, so turning the preference back on later does not
     resurrect old drafts; the file is still on disk.

  The blank-document-on-startup preference (`startupAction`) has its own pair of
  routes, and they are easy to double up: at launch AppKit asks
  `applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile`, but on a *reopen* (Dock click, or opening
  the still-running app again) it asks `applicationShouldHandleReopen` first and
  then — if that returns `true` — runs its own handling, which for a document app
  with no windows opens an untitled document through
  `applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile` as well. Making the document in the reopen
  delegate *and* returning `true` therefore produced two blank windows (#278);
  the delegate returns `false` once it has handled the no-window case.
  Miniaturized windows count as visible, so that branch only runs when there is
  genuinely nothing to bring back.
- **Diagnostic logging** (`EdmundCore/Diagnostics/Log.swift`): always-on
  (opt-out) file logger. `Log.{debug,info,error}(_:category:)` and
  `Log.measure(_:) { … }` (single-line durations) write to
  `~/.edmund/logs/edmund-YYYY-MM-DD.log` on a private serial queue. One
  compile-time level threshold (DEBUG = `debug`+; release = `info`+); the
  user only toggles on/off and picks retention (Settings ▸ General ▸
  Diagnostics). `AppSettings.applyLogging()` pushes toggle/retention into
  `Log.configure` at launch and on change; retention is pruned there.
- **Crash-log uploading** (`EdmundCore/Diagnostics/CrashReporter.swift`):
  opt-in (default off), fire-and-forget POST of `edmd-*.ips` files from
  `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` not yet in
  `AppSettings.sentCrashReports` (dedup) to
  `CrashReporter.reportingEndpoint`. `edmd` is the Mach-O executable name —
  that's the crash-report filename prefix. **The Settings ▸ Advanced toggle
  is currently commented out** (the `// Crash reports:` GridRow in
  `AdvancedSettingsView.swift`); uncomment it and set a real
  `reportingEndpoint` once the receiving server exists. Reading
  DiagnosticReports directly only works un-sandboxed; under App Sandbox
  switch to MetricKit's `MXCrashDiagnostic`.

## 8. Quirks & gotchas (will bite you)

### Build, signing & packaging

- **Build with the compiler CI builds with.** Since the Liquid Glass migration
  (2026-08), CI runs on `macos-26` + `latest-stable` Xcode (Xcode 26.6, SDK
  26.5, **Swift 6.3.3**) — moved up from `macos-14`/Xcode 16.2/Swift 6.0.3 so
  CI links the SDK that renders the new design; `macos-14` produced
  Aqua-only DMGs while every local build (SDK-gated, not deployment-target
  gated) already rendered Liquid Glass. Local and CI now match, so a green
  local `swift test` means what it says.
  - **Historical, no longer reachable**: two Swift 6.0.3-only inference traps
    that cost red `test` runs under the old CI compiler — a `static func` on
    a SwiftUI `View` inferred main-actor-isolated (PR #249, fixed with
    `nonisolated`), and an unapplied method reference inferred as throwing
    and losing its actor isolation (PR #270, fixed by spelling out the
    argument: `forEach { removeTrackingArea($0) }`). Both compile cleanly on
    6.3.3; kept here only so a future toolchain downgrade doesn't rediscover
    them from scratch.
  - The deployment target (`Package.swift` `.macOS(.v14)`) is unchanged by
    this move — Liquid Glass is gated on the **linked SDK**, not the minimum
    OS, so raising CI's SDK doesn't raise what the app requires to run.
  (Naming the toolchain beats `env -u TOOLCHAINS`: an agent in a worktree
  session has its `env` wrappers refused, since the harness can't see what they
  do to the command inside.)
- **SwiftMath fonts**: `build-app.sh` must copy `*.bundle` into the `.app`
  root (it does). Without it the app **crashes the instant it renders any
  LaTeX**.
- **Sparkle codesign — must seal the whole bundle**: Sparkle re-validates
  the downloaded update's Apple code signature (`SUUpdateValidator`); a
  bundle that reports as signed but fails `SecStaticCodeCheckValidity` is
  rejected as *"The update is improperly signed…"*. The old script signed
  only the main binary (no `_CodeSignature/CodeResources`) — **every
  Sparkle update failed** (the v0.1.0→0.1.1 error). Fix: `build-app.sh`
  seals the whole `.app` (`codesign --deep`) while the root holds only
  `Contents/`, then copies the SwiftMath bundle in **after** signing (it
  must sit at the `.app` root — its generated `Bundle.module` accessor is
  hardcoded to `Bundle.main.bundleURL` — and codesign refuses to seal with
  any item at the root). That one unsealed root item makes
  `codesign --verify` (CLI) and `--strict` complain, but Sparkle's actual
  check (`SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors` +
  `kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures`, non-strict) tolerates it — verified
  against that exact API. Developer ID + notarization would be cleaner;
  ad-hoc is the current limit.
- **Sparkle keypair**: public key in `Info.plist` `SUPublicEDKey`, private
  key in the login keychain **and** the CI secret `SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY`.
  Don't let them diverge. Details: §13.
- **`create-dmg` — npm only, three quirks**: install via **npm**
  (`npm install --global create-dmg`), not Homebrew — different tools,
  incompatible CLIs; needs Node ≥20. Exits **2** (not 0) when it can't
  Developer-ID-sign (we ship ad-hoc) but still produces the `.dmg` —
  `release.sh` and CI use `|| true` then verify the file exists. Names the
  output `"Edmund <version>.dmg"` (space); both scripts rename to
  `Edmund-<version>.dmg` before signing/uploading.
- **Stale builds**: `swift build` (debug *and* release) can print `Build
  complete!` after compiling a changed file **without relinking `edmd`** —
  you run old code. Detect: grep
  `strings .build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/edmd` for a long string literal
  unique to the new code (literals ≤15 bytes are stored inline on arm64 and
  never appear). Cure: `swift package clean`; if a visual change "doesn't
  take", `rm -rf .build` and rebuild. `shasum` the binary to confirm it
  changed. Never hand-delete `.build/…/edmd.build/` — corrupts the
  output-file-map and wedges the target until a full clean.

### Running & verifying the app

- **`open Edmund.app` foregrounds a running instance** instead of
  relaunching. `pkill -x edmd` first, or launch the binary directly
  (`build/Edmund.app/Contents/MacOS/edmd file.md &`).
- **Screencapture for visual verification**: capture by window id (reliable
  even if not frontmost): `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` → find by
  `kCGWindowName` → `screencapture -x -o -l<id> out.png`. Crop by detected
  window bounds (the wallpaper defeats brightness-based auto-crop).
  **Never `screencapture -R <rect>`** — it grabs whatever window is in front,
  which on a machine the maintainer is using is their browser (this has
  produced screenshots of Trello and of the agent's own terminal), and the
  reflex fix — `osascript … set frontmost` plus `keystroke` — then types into
  whoever holds focus. Use
  `.claude/skills/edmund-live-repro-and-diagnostics/scripts/ui-harness.sh capture`
  and drive input with `-debug.reproScript` (in-process, no focus steal).
  A `PreToolUse` hook (`.claude/hooks/guard-focus-steal.sh`) denies both
  patterns. After
  many rapid launch/kill cycles window-server state can glitch (tiny
  windows, state restoration) —
  `rm -rf ~/Library/"Saved Application State"/com.i7t5.edmund.savedState`
  and relaunch.
- **Counting an app's windows is the flakiest measurement in this repo — don't
  trust one source.** `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(.optionAll)` (what
  `winid.swift` uses) lists windows the app has already *closed*, so a stale
  entry reads as a window that is still open — enough to invent a bug that
  isn't there. `.optionOnScreenOnly` fixes that but lists nothing for an app
  launched with `open -g` (backgrounded), and System Events' `name of every
  window` is intermittently empty for a process that was never activated or was
  started by exec'ing the binary. Cross-check at least two, and when the answer
  actually matters, ask the app: a temporary probe that appends to a file from
  `Document.makeWindowControllers` counts documents exactly, needs no focus, and
  works before `Log.configure` has run (the logger silently drops everything
  emitted earlier in launch, including from `applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile`).
  `Thread.callStackSymbols` in that probe is what names the *creator* of a
  surprise window — the AppKit frames say whether it came from restoration,
  draft reopening, or the delegate.
- **State restoration needs a signed bundle.** An unsigned debug build never
  restores anything, so restoration bugs are invisible in the usual
  `build/EdmundDbg.app` loop. Reproduce with a *signed* release clone under its
  own bundle id (`scripts/build-app.sh`, then `PlistBuddy` the
  `CFBundleIdentifier` to e.g. `com.i7t5.edmundrepro` and `codesign -s -`) so
  the run has its own defaults and its own saved state and can never disturb the
  maintainer's installed Edmund. `codesign --deep` fails with "unsealed contents
  present in the bundle root" until the SwiftPM `*.bundle` resources at the
  `.app` root are moved aside and put back after signing. Note the isolated
  clone still shares `~/Library/Autosave Information` and the "Unsaved edmd
  Document" namespace with the real app — a draft it reopens may be the
  maintainer's.
- **Visual work is measured, not eyeballed — and the measuring rig is
  reusable.** Aligning chrome takes a dozen launch/state/capture/measure cycles;
  `.claude/skills/edmund-live-repro-and-diagnostics/scripts/ui-harness.sh` and
  `ui-measure.py` are that loop, already encoding the flaky bits (AX-driven
  clicks, appearance forced per-launch via `-settings.appearance.mode`, capture
  by window id without stealing focus). Extend them for new surfaces rather than
  rebuilding one-off shell; they are permanent fixtures, not scratch files.
- **Don't drive the Settings window with System Events** to capture a pane.
  `click at {x, y}` is a no-op, the toolbar's pane items are intermittently
  absent from the AX element list, and the window frequently opens
  off-screen — where `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(.optionOnScreenOnly)`
  can't see it and `screencapture -R` grabs whatever else occupies that
  rect (another agent's window, in a parallel-worktree session). Instead
  add a temporary `showSettings(nil)` + `selectedTabViewItemIndex = N` in
  `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, build, capture by window id, then revert.
  Deterministic and needs no accessibility at all. Note
  `kCGWindowOwnerPID` bridges to `Int`, not `Int32` — the wrong cast
  silently matches nothing.

### TextKit 2 layout & geometry

- **Width not known at first styling**: on load the view may be unsized, so
  anything that bakes the content width (e.g. callout header images)
  renders at a fallback width until a width-settled re-render. Prefer real
  wrapping text over width-baked images.
- **`NSScrollView.contentInsets` kill hit-testing.** AppKit restricts the
  scroll view's content area — and with it every click — to the frame *minus*
  its insets. Reserving half a viewport at each end for typewriter scroll left
  a zero-height live area: the caret stopped following clicks anywhere in the
  window, with nothing wrong in the mouse or selection code. Reserve blank
  space **inside the document view** instead, so every point of the window is
  still over the text view and a click in a blank band lands on the nearest
  character. The exception is a band that is *covered by chrome* — the top
  bars (§6) do use `contentInsets`, because the clicks that inset costs are
  clicks the bar was going to eat regardless. The test is not "is it an inset"
  but "would the reader have been able to click there".
- **`textContainerOrigin.y` is not the inset you set, and the default is
  OS-dependent.** AppKit splits the leftover space between the view's frame
  and the text container's own height, so the origin comes back as
  `(frameHeight - containerHeight)/2` — the inset cancels out. macOS 15
  returned 160 for an inset of 160; macos-14 CI returned 135 and clamped
  typewriter scroll's first line 14pt low (green locally, red on CI, twice).
  `textContainerOrigin` is a documented override point, so Edmund owns the
  value (`EditorTextView.swift`): the pad is exact, identical on every OS, and
  can be asymmetric — which the symmetric `textContainerInset` alone can't
  express. TextKit 2 lays fragments out against the override. Note the frame
  follows an inset change only after an explicit `sizeToFit()`;
  `layoutIfNeeded` leaves it stale. **Measure inset behavior on a flipped
  document view** — probing with a plain `NSView` inverts which end each inset
  extends and produced exactly the wrong conclusion here.
- **Attribute-only changes don't re-measure geometry in TK2**: after
  restyling a block whose height/indent changed, `invalidateLayout(for:)`
  its range or the fragment keeps a stale frame (empty bands / clipped
  lines). `recomposeDirty` and the idle drain do this; new paths must too.
- **TK2 height *estimates* are the root of most viewport glitches.** A
  fragment has a real frame only once laid out; everything else (and total
  document height) is an estimate corrected as layout reaches it — that's
  the scroller jumping and scroll-to-target landing wrong (a documented TK2
  limitation; even TextEdit shows it). Mitigations: docs ≤
  `fullLayoutMaxLength` (100k UTF-16) are kept **fully laid out** by a
  coalesced next-run-loop settle (`scheduleFullLayoutSettle`, wrapped in
  `preservingViewportAnchor` so corrections never shift what's on screen);
  `centerViewportOnCaret` re-measures after its first scroll and corrects
  the residual; undo/redo avoids resetting layout at all (§4). Never trust
  an off-screen fragment's y-coordinate without laying out the span first.
- **TK2 can strand content above the document origin.** Edits near the top
  of a tall document can leave the first fragment at negative y — first
  line unreachable, scroller already at top. `repairContentAboveOrigin`
  (run by the layout settle) detects a negative first-fragment origin and
  re-lays start→viewport inside `preservingViewportAnchor`.
- **A selection taller than the viewport must be revealed at its *nearest*
  end** (`scrollRangeToVisible` override): always revealing the top fought
  drag-selection autoscroll and oscillated the viewport mid-drag.
- **A bitmap overlay must land on the device grid or it gets resampled** —
  and a resampled bitmap reads as *bolder*, not blurrier, because the same
  ink spreads over more pixels. Both halves matter: the destination size
  must be a whole number of device pixels (an `NSImage`'s point size is
  rounded independently of its pixel count, so `image.size` usually is
  *not*), and the origin must be a whole device pixel (a text baseline, or
  a centered x, never is). `mathOverlay` snaps the size; `deviceAligned`
  (EditorTextView+TextKit2) snaps the origin in *device* space, since a
  scrolled clip view can leave the CTM's translation on a fraction of a
  point. Measured on RaTeX equations before the fix: +32–38% inked device
  pixels at the same total ink, with solid-coverage pixels collapsing
  (173 → 31). Read mode pins its `<img>` to the PNG's exact pixel count for
  the same reason (`DocumentHTML.fillMath`).

### Edit, selection & storage integrity

- **Never mutate storage while an IME is composing (`hasMarkedText()`)**:
  during composition storage holds the provisional marked text, so
  `storage == rawSource` is transiently false and `didChangeText` defers
  syncing until commit. Styling that runs
  `beginEditing`/`setAttributes`/`invalidateLayout` mid-composition can
  strand the marked text in the input context — `didChangeText` then keeps
  bailing on its own guard and every later edit drifts the caret (the old
  "delete-drift" bug). Every storage-touching styling path must guard
  `!hasMarkedText()` — including async ones scheduled *before* composition
  began (`+SelectionTracking`'s caret-move restyle). `becomeFirstResponder`
  resyncs from storage as a catch-all. Full write-up:
  `docs/investigations/delete-drift-investigation.md`.
- **AppKit does not pair every storage mutation with `didChangeText`.** A
  drag-move whose drop lands on no valid target (e.g. released past the end
  of the document) deletes the dragged range via `shouldChangeText` →
  `replaceCharacters` and **never calls `didChangeText`** — silently
  freezing `rawSource`/`blocks`; every edit then drifts the caret and
  autosave writes the stale `rawSource` (delete-drift round 4).
  `shouldChangeText` therefore schedules a next-run-loop bypass check: a
  storage `pendingEdit` still unconsumed means the closing `didChangeText`
  never came, and the editor heals by running the same sync (`+EditFlow`,
  `scheduleBypassedEditSyncCheck`; breadcrumb in `~/.edmund/logs`: `healing
  storage edit that bypassed didChangeText`). Never build a sync path on
  the assumption that `didChangeText` follows every edit.
- **A bypassed edit also leaves TK2's selection fixup queued** (delete-drift
  round 6). The skipped
  `-[NSTextLayoutManager _fixSelectionAfterChangeInCharacterRange:]` fires
  at the **next** `endEditing` — even an attribute-only restyle — mapping
  the stale selection against post-edit coordinates and leaping the caret
  blocks away. It moves even a freshly set, valid caret, so the heal must
  set the caret (derived from the pendingEdit hull) *before* the sync **and
  re-assert it after** (`+EditFlow`). Suspicious selection changes arrive
  mid-recompose (`up=Y` in traces); under verbose diagnostics
  `traceSelectionOrigin` logs the mover's call stack — start there. This
  class does not reproduce headless (the test harness runs the fixup
  synchronously): DEBUG builds accept `-debug.reproScript <path>`
  (`Sources/edmd/App/ReproScript.swift`) — in-process keystroke replay
  (`caret` / `type` / `backspace` / `bypassdelete` / `assertcaret` /
  `logsel` / `scroll` / `viewmode` / `readscroll` / `logstate`) through the
  real `window.sendEvent` key path — no Accessibility/TCC needed, works on
  an invisible Space. Pass `-debug.disableUpdater YES` alongside —
  Sparkle's failed-update alert on dev builds is **modal at launch** and
  blocks everything until dismissed. Chronicle:
  `docs/investigations/delete-drift-investigation.md` round 6; method:
  `docs/dev-guides/live-repro-guide.md`.
- **The `viewMode` setter recomposes every block, collapsing far geometry
  to estimates** (~17pt/line base vs ~27pt styled) — `recomposeDirty` on a
  large dirty set defers non-viewport styling to the idle drain. Two
  consequences (the read-mode viewport-drift bug): capture any viewport
  anchor **before** `editor.viewMode = mode` runs (`Document.setViewMode`
  does), and a far `scrollCharacterToTop` must style-then-lay-out
  everything above its target before measuring
  (`ensureBlocksStyled(upTo:)` + `ensureLayout`) — the drain's later layout
  invalidation is *not* scroll-compensated, so landing first and letting
  styling catch up slides the just-anchored viewport.

### AppKit chrome & controls

- **Liquid Glass chrome is capsules, not bars** (26+ only; `GlassChrome.swift`
  holds every metric and both constructors). A full-bleed `NSGlassEffectView`
  the width of the window barely reads as glass — it has almost no edge
  specular or corner highlight per unit area, so scrolled text passed through
  it near-legible. macOS 26's own apps (Mail, Notes, Pages, Photos, Calendar)
  never do that: controls sit in floating rounded glass capsules grouped by
  function, with the document visible between them and **no separators inside
  a group**. Edmund follows that — five capsules for the format bar's five
  control groups, one inset rounded panel for the find bar. Three consequences
  that are not obvious:
  - **`NSGlassEffectView` sizes its `contentView` to its own bounds** and
    ignores constraints pinning that content inside the glass. Padding has to
    come from a wrapper view the glass does not manage (`GlassChrome.padded`);
    without it the find field ran flush into the panel edge, bezel clipped.
  - **`NSGlassEffectContainerView.spacing` stays at its default zero.** It is
    a *merge* proximity: set above the inter-capsule gap it welded all five
    groups into one continuous pill. Merging is for capsules that move toward
    each other; a static row wants the container only for its batching.
  - **The glass lives inside the bar, never wrapping it.** Wrapping was tried:
    hiding a bar only empties the wrapper's `contentView`, so a closed find bar
    left a band of glass frosting the middle of the document. `barHost === bar`
    on every OS version now.
- **`titlebarAppearsTransparent` stays `false` even on 26+.** `true` does not
  just let content scroll under (`.fullSizeContentView` alone does that) — it
  removes the titlebar's own material, and body text ran through it fully
  sharp. Notes and Pages do allow exactly that, but their windows have opaque
  sidebars and short toolbars; Edmund's text runs edge to edge under the whole
  titlebar. Adopting Apple's capsules is not a reason to also adopt the flag.
- **A custom toolbar item can't win a right-click from a view-level
  handler.** With `allowsUserCustomization = true` the toolbar turns any
  secondary (right / control) click over the toolbar — *including* a custom
  item view — into its "Customize Toolbar…" context menu. The view's
  `menu`, a `rightMouseDown` override, and a secondary-button
  `NSClickGestureRecognizer` **all lose**. Fix (view-mode button):
  intercept in `DocumentWindow.sendEvent(_:)` — the documented funnel every
  window event passes through *before* the toolbar acts — and when the
  click falls inside the button's bounds, pop the menu and swallow the
  event. (Caveat: true fullscreen moves the toolbar to a separate window
  this main-window hook doesn't cover.)
- **Window-size persistence must round-trip the frame, not the content
  size.** Saving `contentView.bounds.size` and re-applying it as the
  initializer's `contentRect` grows the window by title-bar + (unified)
  toolbar height every reopen — and content heights below the frame
  `minSize` get silently rejected. Save `window.frame.size`, re-apply with
  `window.setFrame(_:)` **after the toolbar is installed** (the frame is
  only final then), so frame-in == frame-out (`windowDidResize` ↔
  `makeWindowControllers` in `Document.swift`).
- **A frame-managed subview parked at the zero frame sets the window's
  minimum width.** A top chrome bar resizes by `autoresizingMask`, but its
  contents are Auto Layout, so its required constraints reach the window as
  a `contentMinSize`. A flexible-width autoresizing view only grows by the
  *delta* from the width it was added at — so a bar added at `.zero` first
  reaches the width its fields and buttons need when the window is that much
  wider than it opened. AppKit reads the minimum as `initial width + bar
  minimum` and inflates the opening frame to satisfy it: the 800pt default
  opened at 1014 and would not shrink below it, `window.minSize` was
  inert (dropping it to 320 moved neither number), and the initial size and
  the minimum moved together. Fix: size the bar to the container when
  parking it — `FindController.init` for the find bar, and the `setFrameSize`
  before `addSubview` in `Document.makeWindowControllers()` for the format bar,
  which inherits the whole scar. Note this is invisible to headless
  tests — only the live window server applies `contentMinSize`, so verify by
  launching and asking AX to resize the window smaller than it can go.
- **`NSSearchField`'s magnifier glyph can't be repositioned — draw your
  own.** AppKit draws it ~3.75pt below the field's vertical centre (a 21×15
  image in a rect the field's full 22pt height). Every built-in hook is a
  dead end, and each was measured, not assumed:
  `searchButtonRect(forBounds:)` is only a *sizing probe* (AppKit calls it
  with a 40000×40000 bounds, never to position); the button cell's
  `drawInterior(withFrame:in:)` is bypassed by the search field's private
  draw path; the cell ignores a replacement image entirely (the Big Sur
  regression, FB8913004), so re-padding the image does nothing; and the
  glyph is not a subview, so there is nothing to move in `layout()`.
  `imageRect(forBounds:)` *is* honoured, but drawing is clipped to a fixed
  band, so shifting or growing the rect just chops the top off the glyph.
  What works (`FindBarView.swift`): swap in a button cell whose
  `imageRect` returns `.zero` — it draws nothing but still handles the
  click, so the search-options menu keeps working — and draw the
  magnifier + ▾ yourself in the field's `draw(_:)`, centred on
  `searchButtonRect(forBounds: bounds)` (that call *is* correct for real
  bounds). Template images drawn by hand render flat black, so tint per
  draw or the glyph won't follow light/dark.
- **Place a hand-drawn SF Symbol by its *ink*, not its image bounds.** Symbol
  images carry internal padding that varies per symbol, so drawing one at its
  image rect lands it a couple of points off whatever you measured. Render the
  symbol once, scan its alpha for a tight bounding box, then scale/offset so the
  *ink* hits the measured target (`CountingSearchField.inkBounds`). Two traps:
  `NSBitmapImageRep.size` must be assigned **before** the `NSGraphicsContext` is
  made — it defines the context's coordinate space, and a late assignment
  measures at the wrong scale; and a text field's coordinate space is **flipped**,
  so a positive y offset moves a glyph *down*. Both were found by sweeping the
  constant and measuring, which is the only way to settle a sign question here.
- **A first-responder menu command dies wherever the target isn't in the
  responder chain.** The Edit ▸ Find items route to `EditorTextView`, so with
  focus inside the find bar the editor is *not* in the chain — the bar is —
  and ⌘F / ⌥⌘F / ⌘G / ⇧⌘G greyed out exactly while you were typing a query.
  Fix: implement the same selectors on the focused view too (`FindBarView`
  forwards them). Applies to any overlay that takes focus.
- **AppKit rebuilds the window's key-view loop and wipes your `nextKeyView`.**
  A hand-built Tab chain silently reverts whenever the view tree changes;
  `window.autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop = false` is what makes it stick. Views
  that can't become key views are skipped automatically, so declaring the
  whole chain (buttons included) is safe — but buttons only join when macOS
  *Keyboard navigation* is on, which nothing in-app can override.
- **Tab never enters an `NSSegmentedControl`.** AppKit focuses segments
  individually — the focus ring sits on one segment and ← / → move it — but
  Tab always leaves the whole control, so a trailing segment (`›`, `All`) is
  unreachable by Tab alone. `SegmentTabbingControl` translates Tab into that
  arrow handling until the last segment, then releases it to the key-view
  loop. The focused index has no public accessor, so it's mirrored, and the
  mirror must be seeded by *entry direction* — AppKit enters on the leading
  segment forwards and the trailing one via ⇧Tab.
- **`NSVisualEffectView` ignores `draw(_:)`.** It renders its material through
  layers and never calls a custom draw, so a border painted there is simply
  invisible (measured: nothing appeared). Use a pinned subview with a layer
  background, and refresh its `cgColor` on
  `viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance` — a colour snapshot won't follow the
  appearance by itself.
- **An `NSPopUpButton`'s AX menu hides the currently-selected item.** AX
  enumeration reorders the menu so the selected item comes first *with a blank
  title*, and the trailing separator reads as a blank non-menu element — so a
  hand-count of `AXMenuItem`s is always one short of the true menu. When
  verifying the format bar's two pulldowns by AX, read the items by title
  against `FormatMenu.headingMenu()`/`calloutMenu()` (the same factories the
  Format menu uses — one definition, three homes) rather than trusting a
  count.

### Deliberate omissions

- **Edit ▸ Substitutions is deliberately absent.** Smart quotes/dashes, text
  replacement and autocorrect are switched off in
  `EditorTextView.commonInit()` on purpose: they rewrite typed Markdown, and
  the completion machinery can strand marked text and break
  storage == rawSource (delete-drift investigation). Don't add the standard
  Substitutions menu back — it re-exposes exactly those toggles. Same reason
  "Correct Spelling Automatically" is left out of Spelling and Grammar.

- **Edit-mode math looks "heavier" than read-mode math because it *is* a
  different color, not a rendering defect.** Edit mode colors math (and all
  text) with `.textColor` (pure black in light appearance); read mode uses
  the softer `#1a1a1a`/`#e6e6e6` `--fg` palette for everything. Both are
  working as designed — math just matches its ambient text color in each
  mode. See `docs/investigations/math-ratex-weight-investigation.md`.
- **A `//` line comment inside `HTMLTheme.swift`'s CSS string literal is
  invalid CSS and silently drops the whole rule** (CSS has no `//` syntax;
  the parser chokes past it until the next `{`). Use `/* */`. Cost a whole
  round of "why doesn't this CSS change do anything" — see
  `docs/investigations/math-ratex-weight-investigation.md` Round 1.
- **The format bar has no alignment buttons** (left/center/right/justify),
  despite being the natural home for them, per an explicit decision with the
  maintainer: block-alignment has no Markdown representation, so the buttons
  would silently no-op or rewrite text. Text alignment stays out of the bar;
  anything that can't round-trip through `rawSource` does not get a button.

---

## 9. Known issues / lurking problems

- **Images can't be drawn on multi-line (wrapping) fragments** (TK2 image
  wedge — collapses the fragment's layout to one line). Resolved for the
  callout custom-title icon via stroked `CGPath` (shapes don't wedge); the
  constraint still holds for any *new* overlay that could share a line with
  wrapping text. Full investigation:
  `docs/investigations/archives/callout-title-wrap-investigation.md`.
- **RaTeX rendered inline math in display style until 0.1.14**, because
  `renderLatex`'s `displayMode` argument didn't exist yet and the engine
  defaults to display — so `$\sum_{i=1}^{n}$` stacked its limits above and
  below mid-sentence. Fixed by passing the argument explicitly
  (`WasmMathHost.render`). Prefixing `\displaystyle` was never the lever it
  appeared to be: with the default already display, it measured identically
  with and without.
- **The recorded "RaTeX `aligned` row-spacing" defect did not survive
  re-testing and is not a known bug.** It was filed against 0.1.12 by
  comparing two *different* equations rather than one equation across two
  versions. Head-to-head on identical input, 0.1.12 and 0.1.14 both stack
  multi-row `aligned` correctly (four `\lim`/`\frac` rows: 4 clean
  y-clusters, ~10em total, both versions). Nothing upstream was ever waiting
  to be fixed here. If multi-row math ever collapses again, the escaping
  round-trip is the thing to suspect first, not RaTeX's layout — see the next
  entry. Full write-up: `docs/investigations/math-ratex-multirow-investigation.md`.
- **swift-markdown unescapes `\\` before you ever see the LaTeX.** A `Text`
  node's `.string` has Markdown backslash-unescaping applied (`\\`→`\`,
  `\$`→`$`), which silently turns an `aligned` block's row separators into
  nothing — every row lands on one line. Read mode therefore parses math from
  the *raw* source (`sourceText(paragraph)` in `HTMLRenderer.visitParagraph`),
  exactly as edit mode reads by range. The `?? Self.plainText(of:)` fallback
  on that line is the mangled path — anything that makes `sourceText` return
  nil reintroduces the collapse.
- **A callout that is the first block of a document is ~3.5pt short on top.**
  Measured on a fresh open, caret moved off the block: 14.5pt above the title
  vs 18.0pt for an identical callout mid-document (bands 80.0 / 83.0pt). Repro:
  first line `> [!NOTE]`, a second callout further down, compare. (While the
  caret is *inside* it the callout renders as raw source with no background —
  that is live preview working, not the bug.) The top breathing room is not
  paragraph spacing: it is reserved as *text* space by raising the header
  line's `minimumLineHeight` in `calloutParagraphStyle`
  (`+CalloutRendering.swift`), then painted by `decorationDrawHeight` /
  `layoutFragmentFrame` (`+TextKit2.swift`). Check first whether the
  *mid-document* callout is absorbing the blank line above it into its
  fragment — `layoutFragmentFrame` already special-cases the trailing-empty-line
  mirror of that — in which case 18.0pt is the inflated figure and the fix
  belongs at the other end. Also reported and **not** reproduced: pushing such a
  callout down with newlines loses its background entirely.
- *(Add new ones here as you find them — with a one-line repro and a
  pointer to any deeper write-up in `docs/`.)*

## 10. Still to address

- **Raw HTML: Read renders it per GFM; Edit shows colored source** — the
  GitHub split (rendered HTML in Edit is impossible under
  storage==rawSource). Read filters via `HTMLRenderer.filterRawHTML` = GFM
  tagfilter **plus** hardening (`on*` attributes stripped,
  `javascript:`/`vbscript:` neutralized), behind the webview sandbox (JS
  off, `script-src 'none'` CSP, `baseURL: nil`); a raw `<img>` is rewritten
  to the `md-image` placeholder (`DocumentHTML.fillImages` — the
  remote-image-policy chokepoint). Edit renders `.htmlBlock` blocks and
  inline tags as colored source; the `htmlFormatTags` whitelist is
  *presentation*, not sanitization. Spec divergences + full policy:
  `docs/architecture/reader-and-export.md`. Still deferred in Edit mode:
  reference links/definitions, blockquote lazy continuation,
  entity-reference styling, the 2-trailing-space hard-break span.
- **Edit-mode table alignment** distributes each cell's slack via `.kern`,
  putting the right/center "before" pad on the cell's *hidden* leading pipe
  (kern still adds advance on a 0.01pt glyph) —
  `EditorTextView+TableRendering.swift`. Column widths are clamped to the
  available line width (`distributeColumnWidths`,
  `EditorTextView+TableSupport.swift`) so one very wide cell can't stretch
  the table off screen; a cell whose styled width still exceeds its clamped
  column hides its real characters and is redrawn wrapped via a
  `.tableCellWraps` attribute (`EditorTextView+TextKit2.swift`), resolved
  through a detached scratch `NSTextContentStorage`/`NSTextLayoutManager`
  sized to the column's content width — the same "hide the real chars, draw
  the visual yourself" pattern as `.fragmentOverlay`, needed because TK2
  only wraps a whole paragraph at the container edge and has no per-cell
  flow region (that's NSTextTable/NSTextBlock, banned per §2).
  Such a cell still kerns out its full column: its hidden characters
  advance ~nothing, so without that pad every cell after it in the row slid
  left onto its neighbour (#251). Its drawn lines carry the column's
  alignment individually, and a click inside one is resolved against the
  scratch layout (`cellWrapCharacterIndex`, used from `mouseDown`) rather
  than the hidden characters — all of which sit at one x, so AppKit's own
  hit-testing would answer the same character everywhere in the cell. Two
  geometry traps: the fragment's draw point is the row's *text* start
  (already indented by the cell pad, like `.tableRow`'s `leftInset`), and a
  row's own line box starts below its `paragraphSpacingBefore` — a wrapped
  cell has to match both or it draws a pad right of, and a hair above, the
  in-line cells beside it. Column widths also leave the row a little slack
  at the container edge, or a right-aligned column's glyphs reach the edge
  and force-wrap the row. Interior data rows draw a full-width bottom grid line (`.tableRow`'s
  `bottomBorder`) — the header/body boundary already gets its line from
  `separator`, and the last row draws none, so the table's bottom edge is open
  like its left and right edges.

## 11. Quick start for an agent

1. Skim README (what/why), then this doc (how).
2. `swift build && swift test` — confirm green before changing anything.
3. Find the feature's `Rendering/` or `TextView/` extension via §6.
4. Make the change; add/adjust tests in `Tests/EdmundTests` (helpers:
   `makeEditor()`, `ensureFullLayout()`, `styleBlock()`).
5. Verify per §12 before committing.

Debugging a live-only bug (caret, IME, drag, viewport timing)? Follow
`docs/dev-guides/live-repro-guide.md` — trace-reading first, then the
in-process ReproScript driver; don't burn time on headless attempts for
that class.

---

## 12. Working agreements (pre-commit checklist)

Do these **before every commit** (this is the workflow that worked; deviate
only with reason):

1. **`swift test` is green** (all pass). Add tests for new behavior / bug
   repros.
2. **Visual changes are measured, not eyeballed** — build the app and
   `screencapture` the result (§8), or render offscreen to a PNG. Don't trust
   headless layout alone for anything that draws. For anything phrased as
   *align / centre / balance the padding / match the native control*, report
   **numbers** (device px and points, 2:1 on Retina), not an impression —
   "the glyph's centre is 137.5, the field's is 137.5" settles what "looks
   right" cannot. Drive the app with the reusable harness rather than fresh
   one-off shell: `ui-harness.sh` + `ui-measure.py` in
   `.claude/skills/edmund-live-repro-and-diagnostics/scripts/`. **Keep and
   extend those tools** — they're checked-in fixtures, and the setup cost is
   otherwise paid again every visual task. `ui-measure.py weight` compares
   stroke weight/sharpness between two captures (ink, spread, solidity) —
   that's how the math-overlay resample was proven. No python here has
   numpy/Pillow; run it as
   `uv run --with numpy --with pillow ui-measure.py …`.
3. **Frequent, small, logical commits** — one feature/fix each. Don't
   discard uncommited changes.
4. **Don't autopush, PR, or merge unless asked.** Branch off `main` (don't
   commit straight to it); each fix on its own branch.
5. Touch only what the task needs; match surrounding style; don't refactor
   unrelated code.
6. **Concurrent local work uses `git worktree`, not multiple clones or
   branch-switching.** `git worktree add .worktrees/<branch> <branch>` —
   the directory path mirrors the branch name (e.g. `.worktrees/fix/foo`
   for `fix/foo`), so branches keep the normal `type/slug` naming and never
   get renamed to `worktree-*`. `.worktrees/` is gitignored. Distinct from
   `.claude/worktrees/`, which Claude Code's own EnterWorktree tool manages
   automatically for agent isolation — don't hand-edit that one. That tool
   *does* name its branch `worktree-<name>`; rename it (`git branch -m
   type/slug`) before committing, since the naming rule applies to what lands
   in the history either way. An agent already pinned to one worktree cannot
   `git -C` into another, and `guard-branch-create.sh` blocks `checkout -b` —
   so the route to a second branch mid-session is ExitWorktree then
   EnterWorktree, not a branch switch.
7. **Reviewing someone else's PR uses `/edmund-pr-review <number>`**
   (`.claude/skills/edmund-pr-review/`). It gathers the PR, checks it against
   the invariants and the TextKit 2 estimate rule, verifies the claim the merge
   rests on instead of relaying it, asks the maintainer for the calls that are
   theirs, and emits a merge checklist. Shipping your *own* change is `/ship`
   (`.claude/commands/ship.md`) — different job.

If you (the agent) improve this workflow or discover a better verification
trick, update this section.

## 13. Release & CI pipeline

How a release happens, plus the non-obvious things that broke shipping 0.1.0.

**Flow (tag-triggered).** Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag →
`.github/workflows/release.yml` (`macos-14`): build the `.app`
(`build-app.sh`) → DMG (npm `create-dmg`) → EdDSA-sign the DMG →
`gh release create` (notes = the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section, extracted
by `awk`) → commit the new `<item>` into `appcast.xml` on `main`.
`scripts/release.sh` mirrors this locally but leaves the appcast
commit/push to you. The `<item>` also gets a `<description>` (HTML release
notes from the CHANGELOG section via `scripts/changelog-to-html.py`) so
Sparkle's update dialog shows the changelog.

**To cut a release:** bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` / `CFBundleVersion`
in `Info.plist`, add a `## [x.y.z]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`, merge to
`main`, then `git tag vx.y.z && git push origin vx.y.z`.

**EdDSA keypair — set up, not a placeholder.** Public key in `Info.plist`
`SUPublicEDKey` (`0XdLbbuO…`); the private key lives in two places that
must stay the *same* keypair: the maintainer's **login keychain** (used by
`release.sh`, no flag) and the Actions secret **`SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY`**
(CI). Verified end-to-end: a CI-signed DMG verifies against the
`Info.plist` public key (`sign_update --verify <dmg> <sig>`). If they
diverge, the DMG signs fine but every user's update fails verification.

**`sign_update -s` is fatal for newly generated keys** — deprecated; for
keys generated after that change it prints a warning and **exits 1**. This
killed the first 0.1.0 release. Feed the key on **stdin** instead (both
`release.yml` and `release.sh` do):
`echo "$SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY" | sign_update --ed-key-file - <dmg>`.

**Appcast push to protected `main` needs an admin PAT.** `main` requires
the `test` status check; the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` /
`github-actions[bot]` push is rejected (`GH006 … protected branch hook
declined`). `main` protection has `enforce_admins: false`, so an admin's
push bypasses the check — `release.yml`'s **checkout step** authenticates
with a fine-grained admin PAT in the **`RELEASE_TOKEN`** secret (Contents:
read/write). Set it on *checkout*, not by rewriting the push URL:
`actions/checkout` persists an `http.<host>.extraheader` credential that
otherwise overrides inline-URL creds. **`RELEASE_TOKEN` expires
2027-06-27** — rotate before then or releases fail at the appcast push.

**Gatekeeper / notarization.** Ad-hoc signed, not notarized: users hit
Gatekeeper on first launch; the README documents the
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` / right-click-Open workarounds. Developer
ID + notarization (§8) would remove the prompt entirely.

**Never release anything through this pipeline except the main app.** The
tag flow builds and ships `Edmund.app` only. Extension payloads (e.g. the
RaTeX WASM) have their own hosting/release path — never bundled into or
triggered by an Edmund version tag. (The RaTeX WASM asset was pulled from
release pending `erweixin/RaTeX` inline-mode support and the Advanced Math
extension's repo migration — see `misc/backlog.md`.)

## 14. References

Dependencies and prior art worth consulting before designing something new:

- [apple/swift-markdown](https://github.com/apple/swift-markdown) — the
  CommonMark/GFM parser both back-ends walk (§3, §6).
- [SwiftMath](https://github.com/mgriebling/SwiftMath) — LaTeX rendering
  (raster only; no SVG output yet — why exported math is PNG, §6).
- [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) — auto-update (§8, §13 for the
  signing/appcast quirks).
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) — vendored icon SVGs (ISC),
  `Model/LucideIcons.swift`.
- [nodes-app/swift-markdown-engine](https://github.com/nodes-app/swift-markdown-engine)
  — an independent AppKit + TextKit 2 live-preview markdown engine (Apache
  2.0, macOS 14+). Solves the same problems with different trade-offs —
  useful comparison before inventing a new mechanism for an
  editing-experience problem, and a candidate source of techniques (e.g.
  drag-select autoscroll, overscroll).
